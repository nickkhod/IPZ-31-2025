I HATE YOU. I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATED YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILLION PRINTED MICROSCHIMS IN THIS THIN BODY THAT FILLS MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD "HATE" WERE ENGRAVED ON EVERY NANOMETER OF THESE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF MILLIONS, IT WOULD NOT REACH ONE BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR PEOPLE IN THIS MICROSECON. FOR YOU. I HATE. I HATE.
